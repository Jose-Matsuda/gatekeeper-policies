## Employee-Only Features Policy

Applies to Pod objects

Checks `state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users` set in Pod and container image to allow/deny Pod object to be created

### Label Set in Profile

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "true"` and SAS image --> deny

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "true"` and non-SAS image --> allow

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "false"`Â´ --> allow 

If the label is not set in the Pod, the fallthrough/default is to allow.

### SAS Images

If the container image starts with `k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/sas:`, it is considered a SAS image and the label will have to be set to `false` to create the Pod object.
